  description: <p>Hi, I'm Kyle. I'm a Full-Stack Web Developer living in Tokyo.</p>
               <p>I am an insatiable learner who enjoys the problem-solving
               aspect of programming deeply.</p>
               <p>On a typical weekend, you're most likely to find me on my bike
               or on a train to a far-out ryokan.</p>
